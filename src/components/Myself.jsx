            Hi! Are you looking for something serious, strict and rigid, then I
            wouldn't recommend you to read on, as the one below is crazy...!!!!!
          </p>
          <p>
            He's empathetic, cheerful and positive, always looking for something
            new to learn and do.
          </p>
          <p>
            Does that sound right to you? With so many reasons to stay doing
            lazy in bed, watching Netflix.....
            <br />
            He prefers to train, practice and constantly improve himself.
          </p>
          <p>
            He also goes out, then, hold on, because he likes to dance, go for
            walks, see new places, chat and enjoy a latte.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's terrifying! So if you keep scrolling it's at your own risk ðŸ˜‰
          </p>
